# What does this do?

Sorry to dissapoint, but at the moment this is a placeholder for future changes. Currently the most up-to-date C syntax highlighting can be found in the [Better C++ Extension]("url": "https://github.com/jeff-hykin/cpp-textmate-grammer"), however it is planned (eventually) to seperate that repository and move the C syntax highlighting into this repository for better organization.

In the future this extension should be the source of C syntax highlighting for VS Code. Installing it will get you the latest "bleeding-edge" features, and reporting bugs here will speed up the development of highlighting. Once a specific highlighting feature is well tested (which can take a while) it is no longer "bleeding edge" and will be merged into VS Code itself.
