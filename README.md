# What does this do?

At the moment this is a placeholder for future changes. Currently the most up-to-date C syntax highlighting can be found in the [Better C++ Extension]("url": "https://github.com/jeff-hykin/cpp-textmate-grammer"), however the C syntax will (hopefully) eventually be extracted from that repository and placed here for better organization.

In the future this means you should be able to install this extension to get the latest bleeding-edge syntax highlighting for C. Once the syntax is well tested (which can take a while) it is no longer "bleeding edge" and will be merged into VS Code itself.
